## Running tests

To run the tests, you must have Python 3 and Pytest installed on your system.

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    In your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory.
    Install Pytest by running pip install pytest.
    Run pytest to execute all tests.

If all tests pass, you should see a summary of the tests run and their results.

If you would like to run a specific test file or test case, you can use the -k option followed by the name of the test file or test case.

For example, to run only the test cases for the Video class, run pytest -k "test_video".
